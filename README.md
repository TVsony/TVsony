### 2. Optical Fiber Specification Document Chatbot 
**Description **  The Gemma Model Document Q&A project is a web-based application that allows users to ask questions about the contents of PDF documents.
  Powered by Groq's Llama model and Googleâ€™s Generative AI embeddings, this tool leverages LangChain and FAISS to create a semantic search and retrieval system.
  Users can ask questions directly, and the system will fetch the most relevant information from the documents and provide accurate, context-based answers.
  **Technologies Used**:
                        faiss-cpu
                        groq
                        langchain-groq
                        PyPDF2
                        langchain_google_genai
                        long-chain
                        streamlit
                        langchain_community
                        python-dotenv

### 4. Multiple Language Translator & Audio Generator

- **Descriptions:** In today's globalized world, communication across languages is crucial for individuals and businesses. However, language barriers often pose challenges to effective communication. To address this, the Multiple Language Translator & Audio Generator project aims to provide an intuitive and versatile solution for real-time translation across various languages and generate audio outputs from text in the target language.

This project is a multi-functional tool that enables users to:

Translate text from one language to another in real time.
Convert the translated text into speech/audio, making it accessible to many users.

**Approach**
- The approach to building this project involves several stages:

**Text Translation:**

Use the mtranslate library to provide real-time translation services across multiple languages.
Enable translation between various languages such as English, French, Spanish, German, and more.

**Text-to-Speech Conversion:**

Use the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to convert the translated text into speech in the selected language.
Allow users to download the generated audio in MP3 format.

**Web Interface:**

Build a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to allow users to input text, select languages, and interact with the translation and audio generation features.
Real-Time Interaction:

Ensure that the translation and audio generation happen in real-time, providing a seamless experience for the user.
